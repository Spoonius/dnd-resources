> - **Darkvision** Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
> - **Gnome Cunning** You have advantage on all INT, WIS, and CHA saving throws against magic.
> - **Natural Illusionist** You know the minor illusion cantrip.
> - **Speak with Small Beasts** You can communicate simple ideas with small or smaller beasts.
> - **Rage** In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On Your Turn, you can enter a rage as a Bonus Action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor: You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength Saving Throws.
> When you make a melee weapon Attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. 
> You have Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
> - If you are able to cast Spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked Unconscious or if Your Turn ends and you haven't attacked a Hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on Your Turn as a Bonus Action. Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your Barbarian level, you must finish a Long Rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st Level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

> - **Unarmoured Defense** While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.
> - **Danger Sense** Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and Spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated.
> - **Reckless Attack** When you make your first Attack on Your Turn, you can decide to Attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon Attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but Attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
>
>  - **Path of Wild Magic** 
> When entering rage consult d100 wild magic barb table - https://pdfhost.io/v/29p3phkXH_Barbarian_Wild_Magic_Tablepdf.pdf. DC of saving throw for effects = 8 + proficiency bonus (+2) + Con modifier (+2)
> - *Magic Awareness* As an action until the end of your next turn you know the location of any spell or magic item within 60 feet of you that isnâ€™t behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn which school of magic it belongs to. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
